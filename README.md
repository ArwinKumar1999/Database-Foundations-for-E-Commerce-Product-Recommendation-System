# Database-Foundations-for-E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-System
This project designs a database for an e-commerce recommendation system, using customer behavior, product details, and transaction history to provide personalized product suggestions with SQL queries.
This project focuses on developing a robust database system to power an e-commerce product recommendation engine aimed at enhancing user engagement, boosting sales, and improving the shopping experience through personalized recommendations.

Key Features:
Relational Database Schema:

Designed a schema that integrates user profiles, product details, brands, categories, and user interactions.
Key entities include users, products, brands, product categories, user interactions, and recommendations.
Functions, Triggers, and Stored Procedures:

CreateOrder(): Ensures seamless order placement and data integrity.
Triggers: Update product stock after each order or product addition.
Stored Procedures: Automate processes like adding products, processing orders, and calculating recommendation scores based on user interactions.
Recommendation System:

Personalized product suggestions are generated based on user interactions, past purchases, and browsing behavior.
The CalculateRecommendationScore procedure updates the recommendation table after each interaction to ensure up-to-date suggestions.
SQL Queries for Data Analysis:
Implemented SQL queries for extracting insights:
Identify top customers by expenditure and interaction.
Determine popular products and top-selling brands.
Analyze user behavior by tracking interaction times and finding customers who haven't made purchases.
Aid inventory management by listing low-stock items.
Conclusion:
The system integrates business intelligence into the database foundation, providing valuable insights through SQL queries and enabling a seamless user experience through personalized product recommendations. This database structure can be scaled and integrated with machine learning algorithms for advanced recommendation techniques in the future.
